We have gather today, to celebrate 2 people, who can finally have sex. We are gathered today, to witness the matephysical love between the to people, in front of us, and not to witness the physical love, that they are going to performe later today, to consumate their relationship. The sexual journy these to people are going to experience, is something special, since I remind you, that there is no sex before marriage. May your unprotected sex give you many children of god.
As god says about sex before marriage:

Hebrews 13:4

“Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.”

Now to the vows. The groom will start, and the bride will follow.

And know, if there are no one who objects, to the bond, that will imprison these to lovely people, in a loving relationship, for if love is not givin, the lord will strike upun thou.

Do any object?

Well then...

Do thou say yes, Kasper, to take this woman, to be you lawfulle wedded wife? 

And do thou say yes, Simone, to take this man, to be you lawfully wedded husband?

You are know married, in the name of god. Kasper, you may now kiss you lovely wife.

	Have you ever heard the tale of The Demon Hunter and Spirit Savior? 
	\\ \\
	Many believe that demons are some kind of creature. A red gargoyle with wings and red horns. They were. They are not. Demons are human beings. Humans that have done deals with an evil force of nature. Like the devil. Or (Aase implimenter dette). The people who makes deals or pacts with the evil, optain surtain powers. Powers to optain their goal. Most of us are blind to such powers. But there are the few. The few who can resist the power of evil.

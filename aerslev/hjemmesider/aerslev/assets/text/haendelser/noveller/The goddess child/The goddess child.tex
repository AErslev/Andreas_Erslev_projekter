	\large\textbf{1. The legend of a child}
\end{center}

There is a legend of a child. A child born from a cursed womb. She was from a litter of three. One who was born wise and clever. One whowas born with a lust for blod and would always be combative. And herself, who was born to become a goddess. Their fate was written as runes in the northern lights. One would try to save those who would be damned. One would try to kill those who would be corrupted. And one wanted to lead the delicate soul to twilight. Her childhood was, nonetheless, quite normal. She and her siblings lived outside Aarhus, in a small suburb. With a Mom and Dad. A small dog. Everything a normal familly would have.

One day, however, her mother disapeard.

One day, as the family was traveling the sea, there was a storm. The boat was rocking from side to side. Water everywhere, splashing on deck, into walls and into the poor souls faces. The goddess child fell off the ship, into the deep, dark, relentless sea. The water swollowed her whole. She couldn't breath. She tried, without success, to swim to the top of the water. She slowly sank deeper and deeper. Everything went black.
